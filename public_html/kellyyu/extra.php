			<h1>Extracurriculars</h1>
			<section>
 				<article id="brmb" class="post">
					<h2>The Big Red Marching Band</h2>
					<h3>Fall 2013 - present</h3>
					<p>I haven't been as involved this first half of the semester, but I've finally squeezed out some more time, and will be back in for the rest of this season.</p>
					<p>The sax section is also the best section.</p>
				</article>
				<article id="cca" class="post">
					<h2>Cornell Computer Animation Club</h2>
					<h3>Fall 2013 - present</h3>
					<p>We're coming in strong this semester, after having done successful recruiting at the Club Fair, with more structure and tons of added lessons for Maya. One of the highlights of my week, for sure.</p>
				</article>
				<article id="aaiv" class="post">
					<h2>AAIV Christian Fellowship</h2>
					<h3>Spring 2014 - present</h3>
					<p>Where I spend my Friday nights. It's so encouraging to be with people seeking God and His Will.</p>
				</article>
				<article id="bears" class="post">
					<h2>Cornell BEARS</h2>
					<h3>Summer 2014 - present</h3>
					<p>I manage the <a href="http://cornellbears.org">website</a> and match up mentors and mentees.</p>
				</article>
				<article id="crr" class="post">
					<h2>Code Red Robotics FRC Team 639</h2>
					<h3>Fall 2013 - Spring 2014</h3>
					<p>I am officially not a mentor for Code Red Robotics for this year, as I'm anticipating a lot of load from my extracurriculars and academics.</p>
				</article>
				<article id="sun" class="post">
					<h2>Sun Photography</h2>
					<h3>Fall 2013 - Spring 2014</h3>
					<p>For the time being, I've decided to go inactive as a Sun photographer. Fun experience - I recommend getting involved with the Sun at least once to get a glimpse of the behind the scenes!</p>
				</article>
				<article id="dragon" class="post">
					<h2>Cornell Dragon Boat Club</h2>
					<h3>Summer 2014</h3>
					<p>There is something incredibly lovely about rowing out onto Cayuga lake. After you get the rhythm, you get lost in the surge of the boat beneath you, forward, forward, the nothing but water and sky and the not-so-distant shore that you don't really care about, the breathing of everyone around you as each person's form mirrors the next.</p>
					<p>tldr; Highly recommend.</p>
