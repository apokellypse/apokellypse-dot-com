					<h1>Projects</h1>
					<p>Here is where I showcase my independent and academic CS projects. To see things I am currently working on, check out <a href="http://testing.apokellypse.com">my testing site</a> for demos and other webby things.</p>

					<p><strong>Cornell Computer Animation Website</strong></p>
					<p>Cornell uses OrgSync (a platform for university organizations) and provides our club a website with pretty good SEO and a built-in CMS system. However, we wanted our own domain, and wanted freedom beyond what their CMS was designed for, and decided to make our own website separately from OrgSync.</p>
					<p>Since quite a few of our members are here in Ithaca over the summer, we met several times to discuss website content. I designed the final website, which you can view <a href="http://cornellanimation.com">here</a>.</p>

					<p><strong>Personal Website</strong></p>
					<p>Since February 2014 I considered the possibility of creating a personal website. It was only until the summer did I set aside time to go through books and tutorials to learn everything I could about HTML and CSS.</p>
					<p>This website is the second iteration of my efforts. Unlike <a href="http://apokellypse.com">my first website</a>, I decided to adopt a lighter color scheme in response to user feedback. I also made the navigation more intuitive this time around.</p>

					<p><strong>PleaseCall App, Bloomberg Hackathon Feb 2014</strong></p>
					<p>I worked with Junia George, Dashiell Brown, Leon Zaruvinsky, and Keshav Verma to produce our app titled "PleaseCall".
					<p>My role on the team was varied; I did some UI design using XML and worked on some of the database using MySQL. Most of my time was spent studying the Android documentation and learning how to use Git. As this was my first hackathon, I had a lot of learning to do.</p>
					<p>We presented our app 24 hours later and were declared winners. Each of us received a Leap Motion, which was an exciting prospect because of how Leap Motion can be used with Unity.</p>

					<p><strong>CritterWorld, CS 2112</strong></p>
					<p>If you asked me what Spring 2014 tasted like, I'd say it tasted like CritterWorld. I spent eons of time on this project with my partner <a target="_blank" href="http://www.awarmwalr.us">Charlie Qian</a>. The last four assignments in CS 2112 cumulate into a giant project known as CritterWorld.</p>
					<p>CritterWorld involved <a target="_blank" href="downloads/a4-spec.pdf">parsing &amp; fault injection</a>, <a target="_blank" href="downloads/a5-spec.pdf">interpreters</a>, <a target="_blank" href="downloads/a6-spec.pdf">working with Java GUIs and FXML</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="downloads/a7-spec.pdf">networks</a>.</p>

					<p><strong>BrickBreaker, CS 1110</strong></p>
					<p>I have a lot of nostalgia involving BrickBreaker. My first semester in CS was a time of innocence and discovery. BrickBreaker was symbolic of my experience learning Python and realizing that I did indeed want to study Computer Science after all.</p>
					<p>For this project, I partnered with Victoria Beall. This was a pretty fun assignment, although I was stuck one function for a week because I wasn't careful with recursion.</p>
					<p>BrickBreaker was a good project because it introduced me to the MVC design pattern and how to effectively use states to represent the different modes my game could be in at any given moment.</p>
					<p>I implemented this in Python, but I plan on redoing it in JavaScript and putting it somewhere on this website.</p>
