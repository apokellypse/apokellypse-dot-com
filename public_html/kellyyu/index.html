					<h1>Hi, I'm Kelly Yu.</h1>
					<p><strong>Welcome to my website!</strong></p>
					<p>I am a rising sophomore at Cornell University. Currently, I study Computer Science in the College of Engineering and plan to get a minor in <a href="http://courses.cornell.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=18&amp;poid=7706#core_63072" target="_blank">Fine Arts</a> or <a href="http://gdiac.cis.cornell.edu/programs/minor.php" target="_blank">Game Design.</a></p>
					<p>In my spare time I enjoy reading, listening to music, animating, drawing, sightseeing, and photography. </p>

					<p><strong>Where I'm from</strong></p>
					<p>I was raised in suburban Michigan (the mitten!) for the majority of my life. I attended Reuther Middle School and Rochester High School before coming to sweet Ithaca to attend Cornell. I'm a first-generation Chinese-American, and connect a lot with the Asian cuisine my parents have made daily for me throughout my years at home. (can you imagine cooking everyday? That's what they did.)</p>

					<p><strong>Where I'm at</strong></p>
					<p>Right now I'm involved in the <a href="http://mb.bigredbands.org/" target="_blank">Big Red Marching Band</a> as a saxophone and as a member of the band's <a href="http://mb.bigredbands.org/showcomm.php">Show Committee</a>. My Wednesdays are spent with <a href="http://animation.apokellypse.com">Cornell Computer Animation</a>, a club my friends and I organized last year. On Fridays I go to <a href="http://cornellaaiv.com/" target="_blank">Asian American InterVaristy</a>, a Christian fellowship on campus. I've found great people from these three extracurriculars, friends I want to keep for life.</p>

					<p><strong>Where I'm going</strong></p>
					<p>	As the years have gone by many things have changed - my appearance, my height, my interests, my personality, my music tastes - but a few things stayed very constant. These things include my love of books, learning new things, and God, who keeps me grounded on what matters. Right now my dream job would be working at Pixar as a Technical Director (or any position at Pixar, really). I plan on taking Game Design next semester, as well as Physically Based Animation. I also want to become more involved with the Swing Dance Club here at Cornell.</p>
