			<p>What is one interesting fact about Ithaca that visitors might learn while attending this festival? Ithaca was named by Bon Appetit Magazine as one of the foodiest towns in America and is home to the famous Moosewood Restaurant. Ithaca has more restaurants per capita than New York City and its unique placement as an urban center within an agricultural region allows for amazing farm to table cuisine. Our farmers market is one of the best in the country and the ice cream sundae was invented here! Apple Harvest festival embodies this spirit in bringing our culinary and agricultural values to the forefront.</p>
