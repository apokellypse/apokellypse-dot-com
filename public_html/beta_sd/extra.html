					<h1>Extracurriculars</h1>
					<p>I find clubs and other activities to be invigorating and give me things to look forward to every week. The extracurriculars I invest the most in are the <a href="http://mb.bigredbands.org/" target="_blank">Big Red Marching Band</a> and <a href="https://orgsync.com/74357/chapter" target="_blank">Cornell Computer Animation</a>.</p>
					<p>This semester I'm planning to visit <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2370182392/">Cornell Swing Dance Club</a> as well as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/556272671063865/" target="_blank">Cornell Worship Workshop!</a></p>

					<p><strong>The Big Red Marching Band, Fall 2013 - present</strong></p>
					<p>Having done marching band in high school, it only seemed natural to check out the marching band Cornell had to offer. After following the trail of chalkings from North and then taking a "shortcut" that was not a shortcut, I ended up safely in the Fischell Band Center, surrounded by sound and voices and many, many people. </p>
					<p>I picked saxophone that day, and played a short scale audition after having a quick lesson from my section leader, Christian N. I had never played saxophone before, but because saxophone and flute (my old primary instrument) share so many similar fingerings, it was roughly a smooth transition. Also, I had played clarinet in the past, so the reeded mouthpiece was no surprise. </p>
					<p>After that day it has been a blur of music, parading, cheers, friends, hugs, and memories. I am in love with the sax section and there I will stay. Coming in this fall I will also be involved with the Show Committee (ShowChom) in designing the drills and formations that will accompany our shows.</p>

					<p><strong>Cornell Computer Animation, Fall 2013 - present</strong></p>
					<p>I've been animating since sophomore year of high school as a hobby. Animation is the reason why I am currently pursuing computer graphics classes. It's something I truly enjoy and make time for.</p>
					<p>I emailed the Student Activities Office the summer before freshman year, inquiring if there was an Animation Club on campus. From the reply I received it seemed as though in the past there was such a club, but at present there was none. </p>
					<p>Totally not acceptable.</p>
					<p>I visited the office in person (Willard Straight Hall) once I got on campus to find out the procedure for registering the club. For all of you out there at Cornell - it's surprisingly simple. All you need is four people to fulfill basic officer positions, a faculty adviser, and then you're set. The faculty adviser part is usually the most difficult one, but I was lucky because I was almost immediately put into contact with Professor Kavita Bala, who is in the Computer Graphics department.</p>
					<p>After spamming on Facebook groups and sending dozens of emails to those who expressed interest, the club was born.</p>
					<p>Our first two semesters was a mix of Blender tutorials, 2D animating, story pitches, doodles and talent from our lovely Art subteam, club movie outings, Friday movie showings, and a dinner at the end of each semester to enjoy each other. It's been a wonderful journey, seeing what kind of people animation attracts. High-quality people, I tell you.</p>
					<p>Right now we're crafting a curriculum for the fall semester, seeing as last year there were meetings that were not planned well and therefore not executed well. We're going to eliminate the "so...what are we supposed to be doing" stance that many of our previous meetings, especially during the spring, took on. In addition, we may implement an additional branch, Computer Animation Team, whose goal is to produce an animated short during the semester, versus the club, whose goal is to teach animation/art lessons to people every week.</p>
					<p>SO MANY THINGS</p>

					<p><strong>Asian American InterVarsity, Fall 2013 - present</strong></p>
					<p>In full honesty, I have not committed to AAIV for my entire four years. I made very hasty decisions fall freshman year, facing a rough transition into college life and being very unsure of myself and of my faith. I had to find some stability in having choices finalized for the semester, so I decided to commit to AAIV for the time being.</p>
					<p>I was orginally very distant from AAIV first semester, preferring instead to hang with my marching band friends on Fridays, or to sleep, or to do anything besides attending AAIV. I went to small group regularly however, because I found community in my small group that really helped.</p>
					<p>Second semester, I found obstacles I could not conquer by myself. I found myself breaking, and I couldn't do anything about it. I ran to friends the first time, and they helped. But the second time around I realized that there are some things that I just needed to give up.</p>
					<p>God was there for me, and I must never forget how at the pit of where I was emotionally and mentally, He was what got me through. Not my own strength - but His.</p>
					<p>I started making an effort to attend AAIV regularly, despite my woes in my heavy courseload. I played piano for worship team once. That was special.</p>
					<p>I found community in AAIV, and I grew close to people. They helped me be accountable to who I am as a Christian.</p>
					<p>I plan on visiting other fellowships next semester, not because I am dissatisfied with AAIV, but because I didn't give them a chance. In other words, I haven't considered all my options yet. I'm blessed to be at a campus where there is more than only one Christian fellowship, and I want to give them my time and consideration. My goal is to commit to one by next spring.</p>

					<p><strong>Code Red Robotics, Fall 2013 - present</strong></p>
					<p>I contacted the head mentor of Code Red my first semester, asking how I could get involved. FIRST Robotics was an integral part of my high school experience, and I wanted to continue the experience, but as a mentor. I was excited to see how I could contribute to this kind of community which I have grown to be very fond of.</p>
					<p>It turns out that we college students were very welcome to join and support the team. Originally dubbed an Animation Mentor, my role became ambiguous after FIRST announced that the animation prompt during build season was again cancelled. Despite this, I have found the experience to be rewarding - the one time I was able to contribute took the form of a 4-hour long animation activity in the Tompkins Public Library. I spent the time with four students - we discussed different things about animation and ended up putting together a short 2D animation that faintly resembled a "don't drink and drive" graphic.</p>
					<p>I highly doubt that animation will be as much of a part of FIRST as it was when I was in high school, so I am looking towards contributing towards the PR/Website groups or the Programming groups of Code Red, which only seems fitting given my studies in Computer Science and my interest in Web Design. We'll see.</p>

					<p><strong>Sun Photography, Fall 2013 - Spring 2014</strong></p>
					<p>Summer 2012 was when I first started taking pictures with my Canon t3i. Coming in to college, I wanted to be kept accountable to taking photos regularly, so I applied to the Cornell Daily Sun as a photographer.</p>
					<p>I really enjoyed working for the Sun first semester. I met a bunch of cool people in the photo department, which was, for the majority, CS majors (funny how that happens). I went to different events around campus, and felt a surge of satisfaction whenever my shots made the paper. I saw a lot of different lectures and seminars, and grew in understanding of the diverse campus I am blessed to be a part of. There was so much going on in the different colleges that I would never have seen had I not been scheduled to take pictures that day.</p>
					<p>Second semester, what with a heavier courseload, suddenly every minute I spent doing something other than study or homework was one less minute I had to sleep or eat. I recall how I would go to some events and doze off in the middle of getting shots. I remember how the stress I was facing was putting a damper on all the things I did for fun, including Sun Photography. Taking photos became less and less fun because it was no longer in my leisure that I was taking them, but in the time I wanted for other purposes.</p>
					<p>For the time being, I've decided to go inactive as a Sun photographer. I might rejoin again; I might not. This summer I've already tasted that old pleasure of hearing the shutter button snap, of going through my photos, of editing them in Photoshop and sharing them with friends. I've realized that I don't need to have a photography position to force myself to take pictures - I love taking pictures anyways. I don't know where this hobby will take me, but I'm willing to ride along.</p>

					<p><strong>Cornell Chimres, Spring 2014</strong></p>
					<p>One of the tours I had before I came on campus mentioned the Cornell Chimesmasters. Since that day, I had been drawn with curiosity to the old tower and the clanging bells.</p>
					<p>The first time I mounted the 161 steps to the top of the clocktower was within an hour or so of my first CS prelim. I was anxious; I needed a quick distraction. I was walking through the arts quad and decided then and there to go climb the 161 steps.</p>
					<p>Up high in that tower was wind, the shuddering of the mighty bells, and the angular sunlight cutting across the beams that held us in the sky. The tower was also a hotspot for couples, who found the cramped space somehow suitable for a not-so-private moment. I might have been the only person up there who was there on my own. Despite not having the space only to myself, the view was spectacular. I leaned against one of the rails and stared out into the magnificent fall sunset. All the colors were represented in the edge bisecting horizon and earth.</p>
					<p>My time currency was at an all-time low. As much as I enjoy the Chimes, I am not okay about spending many hours a week practicing on the chimes. I also realized that even after a lot of years in music my rhythm needed much work, and that my chimes playing was rather sloppy. I was not willing to sacrifice time for other things to have my audition piece down perfectly.</p>
					<p>It was no big surprise then, when I was unable to get past the first round of auditions.</p>
					<p>In retrospect, I am forever grateful for the chance to try out. Trying out for Chimes has given me great respect for all past and current and future Chimesmasters - for their dedication, for how they climb so many stairs to bring us music, for the smiles they bring when they play favorite songs. I am looking forward to next spring, where I plan on trying out for fun. I won't always have this opportunity.</p>

					<p><strong>Cornell Dragon Boat Club, Summer 2014</strong></p>
					<p>I wasn't aware of this club until spending the summer in Ithaca. My experience being a part of this community easily made spending an entire summer next to campus worth it.</p>
					<p>I remember the first time coming to practice, the cooling summer air coming in drafts across the lake, the members of the club in a scattered circle, talking and stretching. We soon were organized into rows and got in, one by one, into a long and narrow boat.</p>
					<p>There is something incredibly...lovely about rowing with everyone through the Cayuga inlet and out onto Cayuga lake. After you get the rhythm, it becomes all you feel. The surge of the boat beneath you, forward, forward, the nothing but water and sky and the not-so-distant shore that you don't really care about, the breathing of everyone around you as each person's form mirrors the next. We stop being individuals on that boat. We become a team as are actions form a singular force that propels us through the water.</p>
					<p>It is particularly beautiful during sunset. Between hard rows, we let ourselves drift for a while, the boat creasing the water as it glides smoothly through. I've never been so satisfied in a boat before.</p>
					<p>There is also an annual Finger Lakes Dragon Boat Festival, a time of competition, medals, performances, and most importantly, dragon boat racing. I did not race with the club this year, but was recruited last moment by Cornell Cooperative Extention to race with their team. It was excellent.</p>
					<p>Now that festival's over, we allow time each practice for members to jump out into Cayuga lake for a bit and wade around. The water is deep - probably at least 12 feet deep. When you get into the water, the already great view just gets better, because now you are eye-level with the water, and you feel like you are just completely connected with everything around you. The sky seems bigger, the water clearer, and you feel right at home, what with your boatmates laughing and splashing each other. I wish I had a water-proof camera to capture the view of being in the lake on these days.</p>
					<p>tldr; If you're ever here over the summer, I highly recommend doing dragon boating.</p>
